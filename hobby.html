<p> Sophia's favorite hobby is tennis. She has been playing tennis ever since a very young age, and is looking forward to continuing playing tennis throughout her life. Sophia was on the tennis team at her high school, and also served as the manager. She has been looking for places to play recreationally around Madison with some friends. </p>
